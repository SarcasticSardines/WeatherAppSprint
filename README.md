+ Weather App Sprint
+ 12.04 - Geolocator responses logged, index.html, styles.css, and app.js created and set up. APIs tested in Postman
+ 12.05 - Added basic HTML and CSS elements, console logged API fetches. Added majority of variables and added psuedocode to app.js
+ 12.06 - Added more variables, narrowed down API data, and started on searchbar functionality. Added images into HTML
+ 12.07 - Started replacing static HTML elements with API data through JS. Found and built all custom weather icons needed. Built basic elements of favorites page. Tried and scrapped searchbar functions.
+ 12.08 - Searchbar works and shows suggested locations but does NOT populate from corresponding location. HTML and CSS cleaned up and styling was as finalized as possible with the data that works. Was not able to implement local storage with favorites and a function to properly display the 5 day forecast before deadline. Webpage only populates current location data, suspected issues with geolocator function affecting searchbar data population.
+ Peer Review by Sebastian: The design is quite in-line with the original figma, minus spacing quirks. However, the page is mostly unresponsive. The page partially populates with data from the user's current location, and the search bar works, but when selecting a city from the search bar the data does not populate and replace the previous data. As such, the weather app does not work.
